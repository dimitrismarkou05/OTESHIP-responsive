# OTESHIP Project

> **⚠️ Notice:** This project is not open-source. It is publicly available for portfolio and evaluation purposes only.

This repository contains the source code for the frontend of the OTESHIP (Our Tradition... Our Entrepreneurship) platform. The project is an Erasmus+ co-funded initiative designed to showcase the collaboration, educational processes, and ceramic products created by students from special education schools across Greece, Poland, and Turkey.

## Architecture and Technology Stack

The application is structured as a Single Page Application (SPA) designed for high performance, accessibility, and maintainability.

- **Core Framework:** React 19 utilizing Vite as the build tool and development server. This ensures highly optimized asset delivery and rapid Hot Module Replacement (HMR) during development.
- **Routing:** React Router v7 manages client-side navigation, enabling seamless, asynchronous transitions between the portfolio, educational guides, and gallery sections.
- **Styling and Theming:** Tailwind CSS v4 provides a utility-first styling methodology. The application utilizes a fully responsive, mobile-first design system with native support for user-toggled Light and Dark modes.
- **Internationalization (i18n):** The `i18next` and `react-i18next` libraries power the multi-language infrastructure, allowing dynamic switching between English, Greek, Polish, and Turkish.
- **Form Processing:** Contact form submissions are integrated with EmailJS and routed through a custom PHP backend to enforce IP-based rate limiting and secure API key management.

## Key Technical Implementations

- **Accessibility (a11y) Engine:** A custom React Context provider (`AccessibilityContext`) manages dynamic accessibility adjustments. This includes DOM-level class toggling for dyslexia-friendly typography, high-contrast visual modes, scalable root typography, and reduced motion preferences.
- **Performance Optimization:** Asset loading is optimized using React's `lazy` and `Suspense` boundaries. Custom skeleton loading states are implemented across data-heavy views (like the gallery and process carousels) to stabilize Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) metrics during asynchronous operations.
